The code does an implementation of the A* search algorithm using threads in the C language.
By leveraging parallelism, it aims to improve the performance of the search process.
The code demonstrates how to represent a graph using nodes and edges, and how to perform the A* search algorithm step by step.
Understanding this implementation can serve as a foundation for developing more complex algorithms that can be used to search
and explore the potential of parallel computing in solving graph-based problems efficiently.
